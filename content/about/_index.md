I'm a huge proponent of science and modern medicine  
but I believe in **survivor-led** over more clinical approaches.  
  
 **Why?**  
  
_Science is infallible. Scientists are not._   
There's so much bias, malpractice, stigma, and discrimination out there. Clinicians aren't immune to this. I've met dozens and dozens of people working in the mental health sector who perpetuate the very ideals  
that re-traumatize us.   
This, however, is not an endorsement to skip professional help   
and I don't mean to take anything away from science and medicine.  
Clinicians help. They've helped me and helped countless others.  
But remember that they're fallible too, and remember,  
most of all, that medical help is not the end-all that is purported to be.   
  
I also believe that mental health resources  
 should be free, no strings attached.
